2011-01-07  Julius Baxter  <julius@opencores.org>
	* ChangeLog: Created
	* include/board.h: IP config 3 changes
	Remove flash defines for boards which do not have it.
	Reorganise UART and Ethernet modules defines
	<ETH_DATA_BASE>: Changed to point to just past top of stack.
	* reset.s: Remove flash boot options and early relocation boot code.
	Added BSS clearing code.
	* flash_reset.S: Added, containing all flash boot code.
	* config.mk: Added different optimization options (all commented out)
	* ram.ld: Add BSS symbols to help clearing.
	* include/eth.h: <ETH_TOTAL_BD>: Change to 8.
	<ETH_TXBD_NUM>: Change to 4.
	<ETH_RXBD_NUM>: Change to 4.
	<ETH_BUF_SPACE>: Added.
	* drivers/eth.c:
	(init_tx_bd_pool): Use updated version of ETH_DATA_BASE.
	(init_rx_bd_pool): Ditto.	
	* include/common.h: <_src_addr>: Added as extern (symbol from linker 
	script)
	* cmds/load.h: Added eth.h include.
	<COPYBOOT_LOCATION>: Defined in one place now, set as end of SDRAM
	minus the size of the relocate and boot program.
	A few flash functions surrounded with #ifdef FLASH_BASE_ADDR so they
	are compiled in only when the flash stuff is in use.
	(init_load): Whole CFG_IN_FLASH section removed. Tboot default location
	now set as end of ethernet buffer space.
	* cmds/memory.c:
	(testram): Warnings added if memory test will clobber stack. Start
	location automatically changed to end of stack, and test will abort
	if start location is before end location.
